# FreeCodeCamp Tutorial Projects

Welcome to my collection of projects built while working through the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
curriculum. This repository contains my first project, a nutrition label created using CSS, which demonstrates my
understanding of CSS and design principles.

## Project 1: Nutrition Label

A nutrition label that displays the nutritional information for a food product in an easy-to-read format, created using
CSS and HTML. This project helped me to solidify my understanding of CSS and design principles, as well as my ability to
create visually appealing layouts. You can check it by visiting the

As I progress through the tutorials, I will be uploading new projects to this repository, so stay tuned!
